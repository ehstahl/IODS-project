# About the project

The Introduction to Open Data Science introduces students to the ever-expanding world of data and open data sets. With an emphasis on open-source regarding the software and the data, the research is conducted transparently and thus reproducible by anyone, anywhere. [Here](https://github.com/ehstahl/IODS-project) is a link to my Github repository for the course work.
